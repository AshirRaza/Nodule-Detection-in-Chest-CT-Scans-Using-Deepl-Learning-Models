# Nodule-Detection-in-Chest-CT-Scans-Using-Deepl-Learning-Models
This program aims to classify Chest CT-Scans into four different types which are:
1 - Normal
2 - Adenocarcinoma
3 - Large Cell Carcinoma
4 - Squamous Cell Carcinoma 
Two popular convulutional neural network models have been used which are 
1 - VGG 16 (Accuracy acheived = 83%)
2 - Resnet50 (Accuracy acheived = 86%)
